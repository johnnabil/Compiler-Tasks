# Compilers Lab

This README provides an overview of the tasks completed in the Compilers Lab for this semester. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of compiler design and implementation, ranging from regular expressions to context-free grammars and parsing.

## Task 1: Regular Expressions to Non-Deterministic Finite Automata

The objective of this task is to convert given regular expressions into Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA).

## Task 3: Fallback Deterministic Finite Automata

The aim of this task is to construct a Fallback Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) from a given NFA.

## Task 4: Context-Free Grammars Epsilon & Unit Rules Elimination

This task focuses on eliminating epsilon (Îµ) and unit rules from a given context-free grammar (CFG).

## Task 5: Context-Free Grammars Left-Recursion Elimination

The goal of this task is to eliminate left recursion from a given context-free grammar (CFG) to make it suitable for top-down parsing.

## Task 6: Context-Free Grammars First and Follow

In this task, we compute the First and Follow sets for a given context-free grammar (CFG).

## Task 7: ANTLR Lexical Analysis

This task involves using ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) to perform lexical analysis on a given input source code.

## Task 8: LL(1) Parsing

The objective of this task is to implement an LL(1) parser for a given context-free grammar (CFG).

## Task 9: ANTLR Parsing I

This task focuses on using ANTLR to generate a parser for a given context-free grammar (CFG) and performing syntactic analysis on the input source code.
